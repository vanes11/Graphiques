# Graphiques
These are the graphs presenting the experimental results of the original FlashFill algorithm and the proposed QuickFill method for pruning the FlashFill program space. The FlashFillResults and QuickFillResults folders contain the FlashFill and QuickFill statistics files respectively. This code reads these static files and uses the collected data to make graphs.
